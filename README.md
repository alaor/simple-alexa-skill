This skill helps you to find the perfect group to go for a bike ride, it can be a for fun or a training group. :bicyclist: :biking_woman: :bicyclist: :biking_woman: 

You can easily starts the agent by saying:

* "Abrir caça treinos"

Then, you can ask for the agent if a given group has any event going on at the current date, like:

* "Perguntar ao caça treinos se hoje tem treino no pelotão da tc."

And, if the agent matches any scheduled ride, it will give you any information about this group, like days of meetings, hour and the location where the cyclists meet each other to start their activities. Otherwise, it will informes that there's nothing scheduled for the current date.

Have fun! :dizzy:


Notes: I have add two groups which I most go cycling at my city! Feel free to add your favorite groups! :handshake:
